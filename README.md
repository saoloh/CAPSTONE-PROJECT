## Technologies Used
*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Vite**: A fast frontend build tool that provides an excellent developer experience.
*   **ESLint**: For maintaining code quality and consistency.
*   [Add any other libraries, frameworks, or tools you used, e.g., React Router, Redux, Tailwind CSS, etc.]

## Features
*   [List key features of your application, e.g., "User authentication", "Dynamic content rendering", "Interactive UI components", "API integration", etc.]

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
    (Remember to replace `your-username/your-repository-name.git` with your actual repository URL)

This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will compile and optimize your application into the `dist/` directory.

## Linting

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```
